Credit Risk & Default Prediction Model
An end-to-end machine learning model to predict loan default risk, featuring high accuracy, interpretability, and an interactive stakeholder dashboard.

Key Achievements:

Model Development: Developed a Gradient Boosting model to predict loan defaults, achieving a strong ROC-AUC score of 0.75.

Feature Engineering: Engineered domain-specific features like credit utilization ratio and payment behavior patterns to significantly boost model performance.

Feature Selection: Applied Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) for dimensionality reduction, enhancing model efficiency and accuracy.

Explainable AI (XAI): Implemented SHAP and LIME to make model predictions transparent, increasing stakeholder trust in AI-driven decisions.

Interactive Dashboard: Built a dynamic dashboard using Plotly & Dash to allow non-technical stakeholders to explore model outputs and credit risk insights.

Tech Stack: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, SHAP, LIME, Plotly, Dash.
